You buy a ticket\r\t2. Using our OCR scanning technology, â¨            players scan their ticket(s) into an open â¨            pool. Tickets must be scanned before the â¨            pool closes, which is 15 minutes before the â¨            drawing. \râ¢ Types of tickets allowed:\r\to Only tickets valid for the upcoming drawing â¨           are allowed into the pools. We do not â¨           currently accept multi-drawdate tickets that â¨           are good for drawings in the future. \r\to We do accept tickets that have multiple â¨           tickets on a single slip.

The Pooler\'s Share is calculated â¨   by dividing the remaining (typically) 50% of the â¨   jackpot between the remaining tickets (excluding â¨   the jackpot winning ticket).  Players receive a â¨   Pooler\'s Share for each  approved ticket in a â¨   pool.**\r\r4. If a pool holds a ticket that matches one or more â¨   ball, but is not a jackpot winning ticket:\râ¢ The player retains 100% of the earnings of non-â¨   jackpot winning tickets. \r\r5. At approximately 11:10pm after the drawing, â¨    players will be notified in \"Pool Results\" of the â¨    status of the drawing:\r\to Did your pool win? If so, you much are you \t   entitled to?\r\to Is your ticket a non-jackpot winning ticket? If â¨\t   so, how much is it worth?\r\r6. The size of pool is set before the drawing based â¨    upon the amount of players allowed in a pool â¨    (example 5,000 people in a pool). However, a â¨    player can add as many tickets as they want into â¨    a pool, giving them additional shares of the â¨    Pooler\'s Share.  Therefore, a pool can close with â¨    more approved tickets in the pool than players â¨    in the pool.\r\r7.
