Cross-checks it against all other tickets in  \t    the pool to make sure it isn’t a duplicate of  \t    someone else’s ticket already in an open  \t    pool. \r• Immediately after a lottery drawing Poolu will     cross check all tickets in the pool against the     drawn numbers and publish the results in \"Pool     Results\". If a ticket in a pool matches all the     numbers in the Powerball/Mega Millions drawing     and wins the jackpot, we will immediately notify     the appropriate state lottery officials that a Poolu     pool holds the winning ticket, as well as notifying     all members of the pool.\r\to \"Pool Results\"\r• Winning Numbers\n\tThe winning numbers for that particular  \tdrawing.\r• Jackpot Value\n\tThe Value of the Jackpot at drawing time.\r• Pool Win the Jackpot?\n\tDoes your pool have a jackpot winning ticket?\r• Jackpot Share\n \tIf the jackpot winning ticket is yours, how  \tmuch is it worth?\r• Pooler\'s share\n\tThe \"Pooler\'s Share\" you are entitled to.\r• My Winnings\n\tDid you personally win any non-jackpot  \tmoney.\r• We will immediately turn over to the lottery(s) all     appropriate identifying information on all pool     members and their winning share amount to \n   guarantee the integrity of the pool.

You buy a ticket\r\t2. Using our OCR scanning technology,              players scan their ticket(s) into an open              pool. Tickets must be scanned before the              pool closes, which is 15 minutes before the              drawing. \r• Types of tickets allowed:\r\to Only tickets valid for the upcoming drawing             are allowed into the pools. We do not             currently accept multi-drawdate tickets that             are good for drawings in the future. \r\to We do accept tickets that have multiple             tickets on a single slip. Each ticket will be             counted as an additional share in the pool.\r• Pending tickets take about 5 minutes to be     approved. Tickets added before the pool is     closed can be approved after the pool is closed. \r• Players can remove approved tickets from the     pool as long as the pool isn\'t closed.\r\r3. If a pool holds a jackpot winning ticket:\r• The holder of the winning ticket receives  the     \"Winner\'s Share\" (Typically 50% of the jackpot). \r• Participants in a winning pool receive the     \"Pooler\'s Share\". The Pooler\'s Share is calculated     by dividing the remaining (typically) 50% of the     jackpot between the remaining tickets (excluding     the jackpot winning ticket).  Players receive a     Pooler\'s Share for each  approved ticket in a     pool.**\r\r4. If a pool holds a ticket that matches one or more     ball, but is not a jackpot winning ticket:\r• The player retains 100% of the earnings of non-    jackpot winning tickets. \r\r5. At approximately 11:10pm after the drawing,      players will be notified in \"Pool Results\" of the      status of the drawing:\r\to Did your pool win? If so, you much are you \t   entitled to?\r\to Is your ticket a non-jackpot winning ticket? If  \t   so, how much is it worth?\r\r6. The size of pool is set before the drawing based      upon the amount of players allowed in a pool      (example 5,000 people in a pool). However, a      player can add as many tickets as they want into      a pool, giving them additional shares of the      Pooler\'s Share.  Therefore, a pool can close with      more approved tickets in the pool than players      in the pool.\r\r7. If a player adds more than one ticket, and one of      their tickets is the jackpot winning ticket, they      are entitled to their jackpot share, as well as      pool shares.\n\r*In the case that a Poolu pool hits the jackpot,  Poolu retains the right to charge the pool for  any legal, accounting and administrative costs  associated with distributing the winnings to the  pool members by Poolu or any state lottery or  state agency.
